To become more confident, you can follow this actionable plan based on the insights from the video. This plan includes three key steps: changing your inputs, building positive habits, and addressing limiting beliefs.

### Actionable Plan for Building Confidence

#### Step 1: Change Your Inputs
1. **Reduce Negative Influences:**
   - Limit exposure to mainstream media that promotes negativity. Consider implementing a media fast for a week or more.
   - Surround yourself with positive people. Identify friends and mentors who uplift you and inspire growth.

2. **Curate Your Environment:**
   - Evaluate your current environment and remove or minimize interactions with negative influences.
   - Create a supportive space at home and work that encourages positivity and growth (e.g., decor, books, and reminders of your goals).

3. **Consume Positive Content:**
   - Dedicate at least 30 minutes each day to consume uplifting content—this could be motivational podcasts, inspirational books, or TED talks.
   - Follow social media accounts that focus on personal development, success stories, and positivity.

#### Step 2: Build Positive Habits
1. **Implement Daily Affirmations:**
   - Write down a list of positive affirmations about yourself. Repeat them daily, ideally in front of a mirror.
   - Example affirmations: “I am capable,” “I deserve success,” “I am confident in my abilities.”

2. **Set Small, Achievable Goals:**
   - Break down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Celebrate each small win to build momentum and confidence.
   - Use the SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) for your goals.

3. **Practice Mindfulness and Self-Reflection:**
   - Spend a few minutes each day in mindfulness meditation or journaling. Reflect on your thoughts, feelings, and progress.
   - Use this time to identify and challenge negative thought patterns that arise.

#### Step 3: Address Limiting Beliefs
1. **Identify Limiting Beliefs:**
   - Write down any negative beliefs or self-doubts you have about your abilities. Challenge these thoughts by questioning their validity.
   - For example, if you think, “I’m not good enough,” ask yourself, “What evidence do I have to support this?”

2. **Work with a Mentor or Coach:**
   - Consider seeking guidance from a mentor or coach who can help you navigate your personal and professional challenges.
   - They can assist you in uncovering and addressing unconscious patterns that may be hindering your confidence.

3. **Practice Self-Compassion:**
   - Treat yourself with kindness and understanding when facing setbacks. Recognize that everyone has struggles and that imperfection is part of growth.
   - Replace self-criticism with constructive feedback to foster a growth mindset.

### Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1:**
  - Reduce negative media and evaluate your environment.
  - Start consuming positive content daily and set your first small goal.

- **Week 2:**
  - Begin daily affirmations and mindfulness practices.
  - Continue building on small goals and celebrate achievements.

- **Week 3:**
  - Identify limiting beliefs and reflect on them regularly.
  - Seek out a mentor or coach for additional support.

- **Ongoing:**
  - Continue to refine your environment, inputs, and habits.
  - Regularly review your progress and adjust your strategies as needed.

By following this plan, you can gradually build your confidence and move towards achieving your full potential. Remember, confidence is a journey, and it requires consistent effort and self-reflection.
